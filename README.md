## About Me 👩‍💻
I'm currently a **Computer Science grad student** at The George Washington University, set to complete my Master's in **May 2025**. With a strong foundation in **data engineering** and **cloud computing**, I'm actively exploring **full-time data engineer roles** to start after graduation.

I got into data engineering because I'm what you might call a pseudo-perfectionist(is that even a thing!?). I can't stand messy data, clunky processes, or things that just don't "look right." If something doesn't work smoothly or doesn't look great, it bugs me to no end. It's like an itch I have to scratch. So, naturally, I found myself on this path where I get to make things that are not just functional but downright fabulous. Crafting pipelines, optimizing data flows, and ensuring everything "fits perfectly" has become my way of bringing order to chaos, and that's the energy I bring to every project - getting it to look and work just right(and maybe showing off a little).

## My Superpower!
Transforming chaotic data into crystal-clear stories! I've:
- Tamed wild datasets
- Built robust data pipelines
- Made **AWS** my second home
- Slashed computing costs and optimized Spark workflows
- Architected serverless solutions
- Crafted dashboards that speak volumes

## Beyond the Code :)
When I'm not wrangling data, you might find me:
- 🎨 Splashing colors on canvas
- 🍳 Experimenting in the kitchen, where my algorithms are measured in pinches and dashes
- 🎧 Tuning into spiritual podcasts, finding Zen in the chaos of code
- 📖 Currently reading: *The Autobiography of a Yogi* by Paramahansa Yogananda, searching for the ultimate algorithm of existence

These diverse interests keep my creative neurons firing and my soul in balance, making me not just a data wizard but a life explorer too! 🌟

## Certifications 
- **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**

I'm always excited to collaborate, learn, and create some data-driven magic together. Who knows? We might just change the world... one query at a time. 😉
